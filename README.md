problems:
opengl is toooooo slow for only 7 point lights and a humongous sponza model. (I'm thinking that the sponza model creates this huge performance drop, otherwise it is fine with 10 backpacks)

made possible thanks to learnopengl.com.

Currently in section "Advanced OpenGL"

also the code is trash rn, my motiovation was to first implement necessary opengl stuff and then later organize everything so i'm organizing everything now
